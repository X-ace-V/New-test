# Todo Application Summary

This document provides a summary of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for the todo application found in this repository.

## HTML Structure (`index.html`)

The `index.html` file sets up the basic structure of the web page. It includes:
*   A main heading (e.g., `<h1>Todo List</h1>`).
*   An input field for adding new todo items (e.g., `<input type="text" id="todo-input">`).
*   A button to add a new todo item (e.g., `<button id="add-todo-btn">Add Todo</button>`).
*   An unordered list (`<ul>`) with the ID `todo-list` to display the todo items.
*   Links to external CSS (`style.css`) and JavaScript (`script.js`) files.

## CSS Styling (`style.css`)

The `style.css` file is responsible for the visual presentation of the todo application. It typically includes styles for:
*   **Body/Container**: Basic layout, font styles, and background.
*   **Heading**: Styling for the main title.
*   **Input Field and Button**: Styles for width, padding, borders, and hover effects.
*   **Todo List (`#todo-list`)**: Removes default list styling, sets padding.
*   **Todo Items (`<li>`)**: Styling for individual list items, including padding, border, and potentially flexbox for alignment of text and action buttons (e.g., delete).
*   **Completed Todos**: A class (e.g., `.completed`) that applies a strikethrough or changes color for completed tasks.
*   **Delete Buttons**: Specific styles for buttons associated with deleting tasks.

## JavaScript Functionality (`script.js`)

The `script.js` file provides the dynamic behavior for the todo application. Key functionalities include:
*   **DOM Element Selection**: Selecting the input field, add button, and todo list container using their respective IDs.
*   **Add Todo Functionality**: 
    *   An event listener is attached to the add button (or input field for 'Enter' key press).
    *   When triggered, it reads the value from the input field.
    *   If the input is not empty, it creates a new `<li>` element, populates it with the todo text, and appends it to the `todo-list`.
    *   It also typically creates a delete button and possibly a complete button/checkbox for each new todo item.
    *   Clears the input field after adding.
*   **Mark as Complete Functionality**: 
    *   An event listener (often delegated to the `todo-list` parent) detects clicks on todo items.
    *   Toggles a 'completed' CSS class on the `<li>` element to visually mark the task as done/undone.
*   **Delete Todo Functionality**: 
    *   An event listener (delegated or directly attached to delete buttons) detects clicks on delete buttons.
    *   Removes the parent `<li>` element from the DOM.
*   **Persistence (Optional)**: More advanced versions might include saving and loading todo items to/from `localStorage` to persist data across browser sessions.
