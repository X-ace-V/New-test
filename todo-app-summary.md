# Todo Application Summary

This document provides a summary of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code that constitutes the todo application within this repository.

## HTML (index.html)
The `index.html` file serves as the main entry point for the todo application. It defines the basic structure of the web page. Key elements include:
- A header section (likely `<h1>` or `<h2>`) for the application title.
- An input field (`<input type="text">`) where users can type new todo items.
- A button (`<button>`) to add new todo items.
- An unordered list (`<ul>`) or ordered list (`<ol>`) to display the list of todo items. Each todo item is likely a list item (`<li>`) that may contain text, a checkbox for completion, and a button to delete the item.
- Links to `style.css` for styling and `script.js` for functionality.

## CSS (style.css)
The `style.css` file is responsible for the visual presentation of the todo application. It styles various elements to provide a user-friendly interface. Common styling includes:
- Basic body/root styling (e.g., font family, background color, text alignment).
- Styling for the container holding the todo application to center it and add padding/margins.
- Styles for input fields and buttons (e.g., size, color, hover effects).
- Styling for the todo list (`<ul>`, `<li>`), including item spacing, text appearance, and possibly differentiating completed items (e.g., strikethrough).
- Styles for delete or complete buttons within each todo item.

## JavaScript (script.js)
The `script.js` file provides the dynamic functionality of the todo application. It handles user interactions and manages the state of the todo list. Key functionalities implemented in JavaScript typically include:
- **DOM Element Selection**: Selecting necessary HTML elements like the input field, add button, and todo list.
- **Adding Todo Items**: An event listener on the add button (or on pressing Enter in the input field) that:
  - Reads the value from the input field.
  - Creates new `<li>` elements dynamically.
  - Appends the new `<li>` to the todo list.
  - Clears the input field.
- **Marking Todo Items as Complete**: Event listeners on checkboxes or the todo item itself that:
  - Toggles a CSS class (e.g., `completed`) on the `<li>` element to apply strikethrough or other visual indicators.
- **Deleting Todo Items**: Event listeners on delete buttons that:
  - Removes the parent `<li>` element from the DOM.
- **Persistence (Optional but Common)**: Using `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` to save and load todo items so they persist across browser sessions.
- **Event Delegation**: Often, event listeners are attached to the parent list to handle events on dynamically created child elements more efficiently.
