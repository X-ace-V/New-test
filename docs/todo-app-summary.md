# Todo Application Summary

This document provides a summary of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for the Todo application found in this repository, outlining its core structure, styling, and functionality.

## HTML Structure (`index.html`)

The `index.html` file establishes the fundamental user interface for the todo application. It typically includes:
- A primary container (`<div class="todo-container">` or similar) that encloses all application elements.
- An input field (`<input type="text" id="new-task-input">`) where users can type new tasks.
- A button (`<button id="add-task-btn">`) to add the entered task to the list.
- An unordered list (`<ul id="task-list">`) which dynamically displays the individual todo items. Each list item (`<li>`) is usually composed of:
    - The textual description of the task.
    - A mechanism (e.g., checkbox or a 'Complete' button) to mark the task as done.
    - A 'Delete' button to remove the task from the list.
- Link tags (`<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">`) to include the CSS stylesheet and script tags (`<script src="script.js"></script>`) to link the JavaScript logic.

## CSS Styling (`style.css`)

The `style.css` file dictates the visual appearance and layout of the todo application. Common styling elements include:
- **Global Styles:** Setting `font-family`, `background-color` for the body, and basic resets.
- **Container Styling:** Defining `max-width`, `margin: auto`, `padding`, and `box-shadow` for the main application container to center and visually frame it.
- **Input and Button Styling:** Customizing `width`, `padding`, `border`, `background-color`, and `font-size` for the task input field and the add button. Hover effects (`:hover`) are often added for interactivity.
- **Task List Styling:** Removing default list bullets (`list-style: none`), setting `padding` and `margin` for the `<ul>` element.
- **Individual Task Styling:** Styling `<li>` elements with `display: flex` for layout, `justify-content` for alignment, `padding`, `margin-bottom`, `border-bottom`, and `font-size`.
- **Completed Task Styling:** A specific class (e.g., `.completed`) is typically applied to `<li>` elements when a task is marked complete, often styled with `text-decoration: line-through`, reduced `opacity`, or a different `color`.
- **Action Button Styling:** Styling for 'Complete' and 'Delete' buttons, including `background-color`, `color`, `border`, `padding`, and `cursor: pointer`.

## JavaScript Functionality (`script.js`)

The `script.js` file contains the logic that makes the todo application interactive and functional. Key functionalities usually include:
- **DOM Element Retrieval:** Using `document.getElementById()` or `document.querySelector()` to get references to the input field, add button, and task list.
- **Task Addition:**
    - An event listener (`addEventListener`) is attached to the 'Add Task' button (or the input field for the 'Enter' key).
    - When triggered, it retrieves the text from the input field.
    - Dynamically creates a new `<li>` element and populates it with the task text, a 'Complete' button, and a 'Delete' button.
    - Appends this newly created `<li>` to the `task-list` `<ul>`.
    - Clears the input field for the next task.
- **Task Completion/Toggle:**
    - An event listener (often delegated to the parent `<ul>` for efficiency with dynamically added items) listens for clicks on 'Complete' buttons or checkboxes.
    - When clicked, it toggles a CSS class (e.g., `completed`) on the parent `<li>` element, which updates its visual style.
- **Task Deletion:**
    - Another delegated event listener for 'Delete' button clicks.
    - When triggered, it removes the corresponding `<li>` element from the DOM.
- **Local Storage Persistence (Optional but Common):**
    - Functions to save the current state of the todo list to `localStorage` (e.g., `localStorage.setItem('todos', JSON.stringify(tasksArray))`) whenever a task is added, completed, or deleted.
    - A function to load tasks from `localStorage` (`localStorage.getItem('todos')`) when the application initializes, rendering them back into the UI to preserve user data across sessions.
- **Event Delegation:** A common pattern used for handling events on dynamically created elements, by attaching a single event listener to a parent element rather than to each child element individually.
