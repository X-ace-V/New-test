# Todo Application Code Summary

This document provides a concise summary of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for the todo application.

## HTML (`index.html`)

The `index.html` file sets up the basic structure of the todo application. It includes a header with the title "Todo List", an input field (`<input type="text" id="todo-input">`) for adding new tasks, and an "Add" button (`<button id="add-todo-btn">`). Below this, there's an unordered list (`<ul id="todo-list">`) which will dynamically display the todo items. Each todo item is expected to be a `<li>` element, potentially containing the task text, a "Complete" button/checkbox, and a "Delete" button. External CSS (`style.css`) and JavaScript (`script.js`) files are linked in the `<head>` and before the closing `</body>` tag, respectively.

## CSS (`style.css`)

The `style.css` file provides the visual styling for the todo application. It likely includes general body styling (e.g., font-family, background color), container styling to center and limit the width of the app, and specific styles for the input field, "Add" button, and the todo list itself. For individual todo items (`<li>`), there might be styles for padding, margins, borders, and hover effects. Crucially, it should define a class (e.g., `.completed`) that applies a strikethrough or changes text color to visually indicate completed tasks. Buttons (like "Complete" and "Delete") will have their own styles for background, text color, and hover effects.

## JavaScript (`script.js`)

The `script.js` file contains the core logic for the todo application's interactivity. It starts by selecting DOM elements such as the todo input, add button, and the todo list. Key functionalities include:

1.  **Adding a new todo:** An event listener on the "Add" button (or Enter key in the input) captures the input value, creates a new `<li>` element with the task text, a "Complete" toggle (e.g., checkbox or button), and a "Delete" button. This new `<li>` is appended to the `<ul>`.
2.  **Marking as complete:** An event listener (delegated to the `<ul>` or directly on "Complete" buttons) toggles a `completed` class on the `<li>` element, which the CSS uses to apply strikethrough.
3.  **Deleting a todo:** An event listener on "Delete" buttons removes the corresponding `<li>` element from the DOM.
4.  **Persistence (optional but common):** Functions to save the current list of todos to `localStorage` and load them when the page initially loads, ensuring tasks are preserved across sessions.
5.  **Event Handling:** Attaching event listeners to handle user interactions like clicks and key presses.
